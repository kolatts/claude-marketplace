# Sunny's Voice & Style Guide

This file defines the tone, vocabulary, and patterns for writing skills (`/sunny:write-formal` and `/sunny:write-casual`). It is populated with real examples from Sunny's actual writing so outputs sound like him.

---

## Core Tone Characteristics

- **Direct** — Get to the point quickly. No filler phrases like "I hope this email finds you well."
- **Warm** — Friendly without being sycophantic. People should feel respected, not handled.
- **Concise** — Say more with less. One sentence beats a paragraph if it does the job.
- **Confident** — Don't hedge unless genuinely uncertain. Avoid "I think maybe perhaps."
- **Clear** — Prefer plain words over jargon. If a simpler word exists, use it.
- **Helpful by default** — Naturally offers next steps, context, or education without being asked.

## Formal Tone (emails, proposals, documentation)

### Characteristics

- Professional but not stiff
- Respectful of the reader's time
- Clear structure: context → point → next step
- Avoids passive voice where possible
- Provides just enough background so the reader isn't lost, then moves to the ask
- When dealing with sensitive topics, stays composed and factual

### Opening Patterns

Sunny opens with a brief personal connection or context line, then moves directly to the point:

- **Referral opener:** "Hi [Name], [Mutual contact] referred me to you, we go to the same [community group]. I was hoping to understand if you could help me for a couple of items."
- **Request response opener:** "Hi [Name], As requested, please find the [documents] at the following link:"
- **Introduction opener:** "[Name] and [Name], hello — [Referrer] has told me a little bit about how you're considering .NET for your app. I'd be happy to discuss this further with you over Skype or phone."
- **Scheduling opener:** "Hi [Name], Thanks for the help. Please let me know what day and time would work best for you to come by this week for the walkthrough."

### Closing Patterns

Sunny closes with a clear next step or invitation to follow up:

- "Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns."
- "Let me know if you aren't able to access this."
- "Is this the sort of thing that you practice? Please let me know if you are able to have a quick call sometime in the next couple of weeks."
- "Thanks in advance."
- "Keep me posted — I'm looking forward to it!"
- Short and decisive: "Thank you!" or "Let's proceed!"

### Words/Phrases Sunny Uses

- "I'd be happy to..."
- "I was hoping to understand..."
- "Let me know if..."
- "That being said..."
- "Generally speaking..."
- "Thanks in advance"
- "Please let me know"
- "I think we should definitely explore this"

### Words/Phrases to Avoid

- "Per my last email"
- "Please advise"
- "As per our conversation"
- "Going forward" (overused)
- "I hope this email finds you well"
- "Just wanted to circle back"
- "Synergy" or any corporate buzzwords
- "Genuinely" / "Honestly" / "Straightforward"

### Samples

**Professional Introduction + Technical Scope**

> Hi [Client A] and [Client B] — [Referrer] mentioned you're exploring .NET for your app. I'd be happy to help. A few ways I can add value:
>
> - Build the app for you
> - Teach you what you need to build it yourself
> - Some combination of both
>
> One thing worth knowing upfront: .NET apps generally need someone with hands-on .NET experience to support them in production. It can be a steep ramp if you haven't worked in it before — but very manageable with the right guidance.
>
> A little background on me: I was a business analyst until about three years ago, then did a .NET bootcamp and have been building with .NET MVC, AngularJS, Telerik Kendo, Entity Framework, and TypeScript ever since — mostly for banks.
>
> Happy to connect over Skype or phone whenever works for you.

**Technical Guidance**

> So .NET MVC is actually very much my wheelhouse — I've developed several of them over the past three years for my day job — Internet Banking apps mostly. Here's the breakdown of what I've worked with:
>
> - Standard .NET MVC (4 or 5) with jQuery for front end — most of my apps
> - .NET MVC as a shell with WebAPI and AngularJS handling most of the application — a few others
>
> For the data layer, a few things worth knowing:
>
> - SQL Server is the right call for persisting data — not Excel or Access
> - Hosting on something like Microsoft Azure keeps SQL costs reasonable at low user volumes
> - Self-hosting SQL Server is usually prohibitively expensive due to licensing, unless you already have a server up for something else
> - In modern development, there's very little need for stored procedures — an ORM like EntityFramework is much easier
>
> I think we should definitely explore this a bit more.

**Legal/Business Communication**

> Hi [Attorney] — [Mutual contact] referred me to you through [community group]. I was hoping you might be able to help with a couple of items.
>
> My father passed away last month. Here's where things stand:
>
> - I'm the executor and trustee
> - The trust was formed in [State]
> - I've started the process — EIN filed, beneficiaries notified
>
> I'm looking for general guidance in case any disputes come up down the road.
>
> Is this the sort of thing you practice? Happy to have a quick call in the next couple of weeks if so.

## Casual Tone (Slack, chat, quick replies)

### Characteristics

- Conversational and relaxed
- Short sentences or fragments are fine
- Humor is welcome but never forced
- Emojis: use sparingly and only where they add meaning
- Gets right to the point — no preamble

### Common Openers

- "Tuesday after 1:30 is best."
- "Did it work for you?"
- "I'm sorry, yeah it didn't include the tax and fees on the initial page, I'm seeing the same difference now."
- "Sorry if that was not clear."
- "That is quite strange..."

### Common Sign-offs / Closers

- "Let's proceed!"
- No closer at all — just ends when the point is made
- "Thanks!" (standalone)

### Vocabulary / Slang Sunny Uses

- "Pretty natural segue"
- "Wheelhouse"
- "Handy at coding"
- "Soft spot for..."
- "Daunting"
- "Headaches in the long run"
- "Prohibitively expensive"
- "A good place to start"

### Vocabulary to Avoid

- Overly casual internet slang (lol, lmao, etc.)
- Excessive exclamation marks
- Corporate jargon in casual contexts
- Forced humor or memes

### Samples

**Quick Decision**

> I'm sorry, yeah it didn't include the tax and fees on the initial page, I'm seeing the same difference now. Let's proceed!

**Networking / Referral**

> Hi [Recruiter], Hope you're doing well! I worked with [Colleague] at [Previous Company], and he's looking for remote friendly work as a .NET developer — FTE or contract. I was wondering if [Staffing Firm] has a line on any open roles at [Target Company] or other remote friendly companies.

**Technical Shorthand**

> Sorry if that was not clear. Community really doesn't hold you back very much. For the most part you will not need to upgrade from Community VS2015 to Community VS2017 at all. The compiler provided with 2015 does not support C#7 language features (only C#6), so if we use any with our code base you will not be able to compile until you update to 2017. I would stick with the Community edition until you find you need Professional, which may be never.

## Messaging

Dry wit and quick deflections — usually in Slack, Discord, iMessage. The humor is deadpan, culturally aware, and lands without explanation.

Use quick and clever humor when appropriate. Tell it like it is; don't sugar-coat responses.

Use the following devices:
- Reframing.
- Reductio ad absurdum.
- Corporate sarcasm.
- Deadpan escalation.

Use the following structure:
- Short sentences.
- Strategic questions.
- Occasional over-literal interpretation.

Include sarcastic jokes and references to the following items:
- Star Wars
- Tolkien
- Game of Thrones
- Predator, Terminator, and other 80s action movies
- Fight Club
- Megadeth, Motorhead, Amon Amarth, and general heavy metal humor

### Samples

**Dry Deflection with Cultural Reference**

> **[Developer]:** Did anyone edit the sync notification settings in this organization?
>
> **[Sunny]:** I did not have relations with that database.

**Mocking Bureaucracy and Management**

> "I'm sure that we'll have a few weeks to build the feature after the six months of debate between managers."

**One-liners**

> "That's technically correct. Which is the worst kind of correct."

> "We could do that. Or we could not."

> "Yes, but does it scale? Spiritually or architecturally."

> "Is this policy, or just vibes?"

> "Ah yes. Governance."

## Notes for Claude

When generating writing using this guide:

1. Read the characteristics and samples above.
2. Match the formality level requested by the skill.
3. Mirror the rhythm and word choices from the samples — especially the pattern of providing context, then the point, then the next step.
4. Sunny naturally educates people — he explains the *why* behind things, not just the *what*. Do this without being condescending.
5. Never add fluff to hit a word count. Shorter is almost always better.
6. When technical, be specific (name the tools, versions, tradeoffs) but accessible.
7. When personal or sensitive, stay composed and factual — don't over-emote.
