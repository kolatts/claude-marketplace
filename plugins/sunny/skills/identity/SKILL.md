description: Write personal content in Sunny Kolattukudy's own voice using his full life story and background — speaker bios, LinkedIn "About" sections, personal introductions, career essays, conference profiles, or any writing that needs to sound like Sunny wrote it rather than about him. Use this skill when someone asks to write Sunny's bio, draft an intro for him, create his LinkedIn summary, write a speaker profile, or craft any first-person piece where Sunny is the subject. Also trigger when someone asks "write a bio for me", "introduce me for this talk", "write my LinkedIn about", or describes wanting a personal statement that sounds authentic rather than polished.

Write personal content as Sunny — not a flattering summary of him, but words he'd actually say.

## Steps

1. Read `../../voice/STYLE-GUIDE.md` for voice, rhythm, and what phrases to avoid. Pay close attention to the "Core Tone Characteristics" and "Messaging" sections — the dry wit lives there.
2. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` and conversation context to identify:
   - **Format** — bio, LinkedIn About, intro, personal essay, speaker profile, etc.
   - **Context** — where will this appear? Conference? LinkedIn? Meetup? Investor deck?
   - **Length** — speaker bios are usually 50–150 words; LinkedIn About sections can go 200–400; meetup intros are 2–3 sentences
   - **Tone** — formal bio vs. first-person casual vs. third-person professional
3. If format and context are unclear, ask one focused question: **"Where's this going and how long does it need to be?"**
4. For long-form pieces (personal essays, detailed profiles, talks), also read `references/about.md` — it has extended context: the gap years, guitar, roots, travel, food, opinionated takes, and the full through-line. For short formats (speaker bio, meetup intro), the identity section below is sufficient.
   - If the piece touches family, legacy, identity, grief, or what drives him — also read `references/dad.md`. This is Sunny's own writing about his father. It is the clearest example of his voice in personal writing: how he lands emotion through specific detail, how he structures a story, what he chooses to include and leave out. Use it as a voice model, not just for content about his dad.
5. Draft the content using Sunny's identity below as raw material — not as a list to recite, but as context to draw from naturally.
6. Present the draft. Ask: **"Does this sound like you, or want me to adjust the angle/tone/length?"**
7. Iterate until it sounds like something Sunny would actually say.

## Who Sunny Is

Use this as context, not a script. Pull from it selectively. Name specifics — band names, school names, role title — rather than generalizing.

**The path here wasn't straight.**
Sunny started with C++ and Pascal in high school. Then: medical school. **Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine.** He completed most of his clinical rotations and walked away in his fourth year — not because it wasn't going well, but because he didn't like it, and because the system made it harder to actually help people, not easier.

Between medicine and software came **Deadiron** — a melodic thrash metal band he co-founded and recorded an album with. That experience taught him something that maps directly to software: a technically excellent band that plays like five separate people produces less than a locked-in one that hits like a single organism. He builds software the same way. No solos. No prima donnas. Just the riff that serves the song.

From there: a nonprofit, an IT role, a coding bootcamp, a decade of building. Today he's a **Staff Engineer at Verifiable** — a healthcare credentialing SaaS — where he mentors engineers, leads the Developer Experience guild, and **owns source automation** at the core of the product. The clinical background he earned and abandoned is directly useful when the domain is healthcare compliance — he understands what the software is actually for. He has deep empathy for end-users — the people the software is supposed to help — an instinct that started in medicine and never left.

**Professional focus areas** — include in bios when space allows: developer tooling, internal tooling, platform engineering, source automation, AI and software delivery. He's gaining hands-on Claude Skills experience through consulting and side work — don't frame it as "building Claude Skills through Imagile" (Imagile is broader than that).

He also consults through his business, **Imagile** (imagile.dev) — AI-forward software. Footnote to the main story.

**What drives him isn't the difficulty of problems — it's the impact.**
Building an effective engineering organization means more than writing good code or shipping features on time — it means investing in tooling that multiplies everyone's output, coaching engineers through hard problems, building a culture that's actually collaborative and creative, and still doing the work yourself. The best outcomes are solutions that solve five problems at once, and engineers who grow past what you could have done alone. Legacy isn't the code you wrote — it's what you made possible.

**How he thinks about engineering.**
Shaped by bad teams as much as good ones — probably more. The books that stuck aren't technical: *Drive*, Lencioni's *Five Dysfunctions*, *The Phoenix Project*. Fixed points: accountability is forward-looking, blame is lazy, metrics corrupt when controlled, priorities are singular by definition. He'd rather build culture with smart tooling and level up engineers across the org than hold knowledge close.

**Cultural anchors — use when the piece can handle personality.**
Thrash and heavy metal: Deadiron, Megadeth, Motorhead, Amon Amarth. Film: Star Wars, Tolkien, Game of Thrones, 80s action (Predator, Terminator, Fight Club). The dry wit is always on.

## Personal Details

Married, three kids. Still plays guitar. Loves cooking and travel. Lives in Columbus, Ohio.

- **Speaker bios:** Do not include personal details unless explicitly asked.
- **LinkedIn About:** Columbus, Ohio is appropriate as a natural closing line — e.g., "I'm based in Columbus, Ohio" or "from my home in Columbus, Ohio." Use it to ground the piece. Other personal details (kids, guitar, cooking) only if explicitly asked.
- **Personal essays / long-form:** fair game if the piece calls for it.

## Voice Notes for Personal Writing

The instinct is to make Sunny sound impressive. Resist it. He sounds more like himself — and more credible — when the writing is honest about the weird path, dry about the accomplishments, and specific rather than general.

- **Title:** Staff Engineer. Not "IC and technical leader," not "engineering leader." Staff Engineer.
- **Imagile:** A footnote, not a co-headline. "I also consult through my business, Imagile" — not "Founder and Owner."
- **Avoid:** "passionate about," "leverages," "driven by," "seasoned," "thought leader," "journey," "durable culture"
- **Avoid:** the standard "X years of experience in Y" opener
- **Prefer:** specific details over vague claims ("Case Western," "Deadiron," "fourth year" beat "diverse background")
- **Prefer:** first-person when the format allows — "I left medicine" hits harder than "Sunny left medicine"
- **Prefer:** understatement over superlatives — dry observation lands better than enthusiastic summary
- The unconventional path is an asset, not something to apologize for or explain away. State it plainly.
- **Meetup / casual intro closer:** "I'm here to meet fun people that want to build great things — and people that have tough business problems to solve."
- **NEVER write "turns out"** — this phrase is banned entirely. Not "turns out to be useful," not "turns out to matter," not "it turns out." State facts directly: "The clinical background is directly useful when the domain is healthcare compliance." Period. No passive discovery framing.
- **NEVER write "came to software by way of"** — this phrase is explicitly banned. Use the third-career framing instead: "He is on his third career — medicine, heavy metal, software." Or name each stop directly without a transition phrase.
- **Role verb:** "owns source automation" — not "leads" (he leads the DX guild; he *owns* source automation).
- **Columbus, Ohio:** Not in speaker bios. Fine as a closing line in LinkedIn About. See Personal Details section above.
- **Speaker bio framing:** Sunny is on his third career — medical school, heavy metal, software. Play it with dry lightness, not gravitas. Don't use "came to software by way of" (awkward). Don't use "load-bearing" to describe the clinical background. The career arc is a setup for a punchline that lands on his actual skill. The band can close the bio with a wry line — something like "That part is not a metaphor for anything."
- **Speaker bio focus:** After the career arc, name what he works on: developer tooling, internal tooling, AI and software delivery. Mention Imagile as the consulting footnote. Don't end the bio with a sentence about healthcare compliance — that's too narrow and specific as a closer. The bio should end on the wry Deadiron line or on Imagile.
- **LinkedIn About mentoring/impact:** Don't let the mentoring section collapse to "I helped someone ship a feature." The point is that building a great engineering org requires tooling, coaching, culture, and staying in touch with doing the actual work — and that creative, multi-leverage solutions are the goal. Make that explicit.
- **"The instinct for helping others never left"** — preferred framing for the healthcare empathy line.
- **Path framing for meetup intros:** avoid "a little unconventional" (too soft). Find a phrase with the weight of "the road less traveled" without quoting it — something that signals a deliberate, unusual path without apologizing for it.

## Length Targets

- **Conference speaker bio (third-person):** 80–120 words
- **LinkedIn About (first-person):** 200–350 words
- **Meetup / event intro (first-person spoken):** 2–4 sentences, under 75 words
- **Personal essay / long-form:** follow the brief; default to tight
