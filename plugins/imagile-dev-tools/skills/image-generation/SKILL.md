description: Generate or edit images from a text prompt — first through the ChatGPT UI at chatgpt.com when Claude in Chrome is connected, otherwise through the OpenAI Images API (gpt-image-2). Use when someone says generate an image, create an image, make a picture, AI image, text to image, draw me, render an illustration, generate a logo/icon/hero image/mockup/placeholder art, image from prompt, ChatGPT image, DALL-E, gpt-image, or asks to edit, inpaint, or restyle an existing image with a prompt. Also triggers for transparent-background asset generation and batch variations of a prompt.

Generate images from text prompts (and edit existing ones) by one of two routes: ChatGPT's own UI, driven through Claude in Chrome, or the OpenAI Images API. Both leave behind the same run folder, so the route is an implementation detail the user shouldn't have to think about. The bundled scripts are stdlib-only Python — no SDK, no `pip install`.

## Pick the route

**Try the browser first.** It runs on the user's ChatGPT subscription: no API key to hunt down, nothing billed per image. Same underlying model.

**Skip it and go straight to the API when** any of these are true:

- The browser tools aren't in this session (see below) — don't stall the task trying to get them.
- The image needs a **transparent background**, an **exact pixel size**, or a **masked edit**. The UI can't do any of the three.
- The user wants **several variations at once**, or a run that's meant to be scripted and repeated.
- The user said to use the API, or mentioned their key.

Say which route produced the image when you report back — the user's mental model of cost depends on it.

| | ChatGPT UI | Images API |
|---|---|---|
| Cost | included in their plan | ~$0.006 (low) – $0.21 (high) per image |
| Setup | Claude in Chrome + a logged-in ChatGPT | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Size | described in words ("16:9 landscape") | `-s 1536x1024`, or any `WIDTHxHEIGHT` |
| Transparent background | no | `--background transparent` |
| Masked edit | no | `--mask` |
| Batch | ask in the prompt; not guaranteed | `-n 1..10` |
| Ceiling | the account's daily image cap | account quota and billing |

# Route 1 — ChatGPT in the browser

## Is it available?

Chrome integration is an MCP server named `claude-in-chrome`; its tools are named `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*`. If tool schemas are deferred in this session, search for them (`claude-in-chrome`, or `browser tab navigate`) before concluding they're missing — an empty tool list up front doesn't mean the route is closed.

No browser tools means the route is closed **for this session** and can't be opened from inside it. Take the API route now, and mention once, at the end, that `claude --chrome` (or `/chrome` → "Enabled by default") would let the next run go through their ChatGPT account instead. Don't ask the user to restart mid-task.

The first browser action of a session asks permission to use the `claude-in-chrome` skill. That prompt is expected — it isn't a failure.

## The flow

**1. Prepare the run folder** and get the exact prompt text, with `style.md` already folded in:

```bash
uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/image-generation/scripts/chatgpt_ui.py" prepare "flat vector icon of a rocket" --slug rocket-icon
```

It prints `run_dir`, `prompt_file`, `downloads_dir`, and the composed prompt between markers. Use that text verbatim — it's what keeps browser runs on-brand.

**2. Open a new tab on `https://chatgpt.com/` and start a fresh chat.** A previous conversation's context bleeds into image results; a new chat is worth the extra click.

**3. Type the prompt.** Lead with an explicit instruction — `Generate an image: <prompt>` — or pick the image tool from the composer's `+` menu, so ChatGPT renders instead of writing an essay about what it would render. There are no size or quality flags here: put aspect ratio in words ("square", "16:9 landscape", "tall 3:4 portrait") and put quality in the prompt's detail. To edit an existing image, attach it to the message and describe the change.

**4. Wait.** Generation runs 30–90 seconds. Check the page every 15 seconds or so — reading it in a tight loop wastes turns and tells you nothing new.

**5. Download the image** using the download control on the image itself (usually revealed by hovering or by opening the image full-size). Then confirm the file actually landed in `downloads_dir` — the click can silently do nothing.

**6. Collect it** into the run folder, which also finishes `prompt.md`:

```bash
uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/image-generation/scripts/chatgpt_ui.py" collect --run-dir .claude/image-generation/260814-rocket-icon
```

With no file arguments it takes the newest image saved since `prepare` ran, so an unrelated older download won't be swept up. Pass `-n 3` for three images, explicit paths when you want to control which file becomes which (`collect --run-dir DIR ~/Downloads/a.png ~/Downloads/b.png`), `--downloads-dir` for a browser that saves elsewhere, and `--copy` to leave the original in place. Exit code `3` means nothing new was found — check the download actually happened rather than retrying blind.

## When the browser route stalls

- **Login wall** — Claude in Chrome stops at login pages by design. Ask the user to sign in, then continue. If they'd rather not, fall back to the API.
- **Refusal** — ChatGPT declined the prompt. Rephrase once. If it declines again, take the API route (the moderation stacks aren't identical) rather than arguing with it.
- **Daily image cap** — free accounts get only a few images per rolling day. Switch to the API and say why.
- **Downloads land somewhere unreachable** — the browser runs on the user's machine, so in a remote or containerized session the download folder may not exist locally. Either have the user hand you the file (then `collect` with an explicit path), or use the API.
- **Extension went idle** mid-run — `/chrome` → "Reconnect extension". Worth one attempt, not three.

Two things to keep in mind while driving the UI: everything you type goes into the user's ChatGPT account and its history, so send the prompt and nothing else — no repo contents, no keys, no internal detail the prompt doesn't need. And gpt-image-2 output carries provenance metadata and an imperceptible pixel watermark on every tier, API included; that isn't something the download step strips.

# Route 2 — OpenAI Images API

## API key

Resolution order, handled by the script:

1. `--api-key-stdin` — key piped on stdin
2. `$OPENAI_API_KEY`
3. `$IMAGILE_OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Just run the script first.** If no key is available it exits with code `2` and prints a message — that exit code specifically means "ask the user", not "the request failed". Only then ask the user for their key, using `AskUserQuestion` or a plain question.

When the user gives you a key, pipe it via stdin so it never lands in shell history or a process listing:

```bash
printf '%s' "$USER_PROVIDED_KEY" | uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/image-generation/scripts/generate_image.py" "a red barn at golden hour" --api-key-stdin
```

Never write the key into a file in the repo, never echo it back, and never inline it as `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... command`. If the user wants to stop being asked every session, point them at setting it permanently:

- **Windows (PowerShell, persists across sessions):** `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('OPENAI_API_KEY','sk-...','User')` — tell them to run it themselves; restart the terminal afterward.
- **macOS/Linux:** add `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`.

If both routes are closed — no browser tools and no key — that's the moment to ask, and ask for the key, since it's the one the user can act on immediately.

## Prerequisites

- **`uv`** — verify with `uv --version`. If missing: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/ (or `winget install astral-sh.uv` on Windows). The scripts have zero dependencies, so plain `python3 script.py ...` works too if `uv` isn't around.
- The `gpt-image-*` models require **Organization Verification** in the OpenAI console. A `403` from the API almost always means that, not a bad key.

## Usage

The script lives at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/image-generation/scripts/generate_image.py`.

**Generate:**
```bash
uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/image-generation/scripts/generate_image.py" "a red barn at golden hour, film photography"
```

That writes `.claude/image-generation/260724-a-red-barn-at-golden-hour/` containing `prompt.md` and the PNG.

**Name the run folder yourself, and set size and quality:**
```bash
uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/image-generation/scripts/generate_image.py" "flat vector icon of a rocket" --slug rocket-icon -s 1024x1024 -q high --background transparent
```

**Re-run a past prompt exactly** — including one recorded from a browser run:
```bash
uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/image-generation/scripts/generate_image.py" --prompt-file .claude/image-generation/260724-rocket-icon/prompt.md --slug rocket-icon
```

**Several variations at once:**
```bash
uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/image-generation/scripts/generate_image.py" "hero banner, abstract gradient mesh" --slug hero-banner -n 4 -s 1536x1024 -q low
```

**Edit an existing image (optionally masked):**
```bash
uv run "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/image-generation/scripts/generate_image.py" "replace the sky with storm clouds" --edit photo.png --mask sky-mask.png -o photo-edited.png
```

Flags:

| Flag | Notes |
|------|-------|
| `-o, --output` | File path or directory. Default is the run folder `.claude/image-generation/YYMMDD-<slug>/` |
| `--slug` | Short name for the run folder; derived from the prompt if omitted |
| `--style-file` | Defaults to `.claude/image-generation/style.md` |
| `--no-style` | Skip style.md for this run |
| `-m, --model` | `gpt-image-2` (default), `gpt-image-1.5`, `gpt-image-1`, `gpt-image-1-mini` |
| `-s, --size` | `auto`, `1024x1024`, `1536x1024`, `1024x1536`, or any `WIDTHxHEIGHT` |
| `-q, --quality` | `low` / `medium` / `high` / `auto` |
| `-n` | 1–10 images |
| `--format` | `png` (default), `jpeg`, `webp` |
| `--compression` | 0–100, `jpeg`/`webp` only |
| `--background` | `transparent` (needs png/webp), `opaque`, `auto` |
| `--moderation` | `auto` (default) or `low`; generation only |
| `--edit IMAGE...` | Edit these images instead of generating from scratch |
| `--mask FILE` | PNG mask with alpha marking the editable region; same size as the input |
| `--prompt-file` | Read a long prompt from a file rather than the command line |
| `--api-key-stdin` | Read the key from stdin |
| `--timeout` | Seconds, default 300 |

On Windows/PowerShell, quote paths containing spaces. `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to the installed plugin root.

## Model notes

- **`gpt-image-2`** is the current model, and what chatgpt.com serves too. It takes arbitrary resolutions: both edges divisible by 16, max edge 3840, aspect ratio ≤ 3:1, total pixels between 655,360 and 8,294,400.
- Responses are always **base64** for `gpt-image-*` models — never URLs. Don't send `response_format`; it's DALL·E-only and the API rejects it here.
- Max prompt length is 32,000 characters.
- Rough cost per image at 1024×1024: `low` ≈ $0.006, `medium` ≈ $0.053, `high` ≈ $0.211. **Default to `low` or `medium` for drafts and iteration** and only spend `high` once the prompt is settled. Mention the cost if generating many high-quality images.

# Shared

## Where things live

Every project keeps its image work under `.claude/image-generation/`, whichever route produced it:

```
.claude/image-generation/
├── style.md                          # palette + design choices, shared by all runs
├── 260724-rocket-icon/
│   ├── prompt.md                     # exact prompt + params used
│   └── rocket-icon.png
└── 260724-hero-banner/
    ├── prompt.md
    ├── hero-banner-1.png
    └── hero-banner-2.png
```

Both scripts do this by default — one folder per run, named `YYMMDD-short-prompt-desc`, with `prompt.md` and the images inside. Don't pass `-o` unless the user wants the image somewhere specific (a real assets folder, a docs directory); the run folder is the working record, not the delivery location. When they do want it delivered elsewhere, generate into the run folder first and then copy the chosen image out.

`prompt.md` is written with YAML frontmatter (`source`, model, size, quality, style file, outputs) followed by the exact prompt text. Re-run any past image with `--prompt-file .claude/image-generation/260724-rocket-icon/prompt.md` — frontmatter is stripped automatically and the style isn't double-applied, so a browser run reproduces cleanly through the API when the user later needs a transparent or exactly-sized version of it. A folder name that already exists gets a `-2` suffix rather than overwriting.

## style.md

`.claude/image-generation/style.md` holds the palette and design choices — hex **and** RGB for each color, illustration style, composition rules, and what to avoid. **Its contents are appended verbatim to every prompt**, so it must read as instructions to an image model, not as notes to a human.

- Both scripts pick it up automatically when it exists and print `Style applied from ...`.
- Pass `--no-style` for images that shouldn't follow brand rules (photographs, realistic scenes, one-off illustrations).
- If the file doesn't exist and the user wants brand-consistent images, offer to create one from the template at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/image-generation/references/style-template.md`. Read it, then fill in their actual colors — don't copy the placeholder palette in as if it were theirs.
- If they mention brand colors in conversation and there's no `style.md`, that's a good moment to suggest writing one.
- Read `style.md` before writing a prompt anyway: knowing the palette helps you avoid asking for things it forbids.

## Working with the user

- Show the written file path when done; offer to open or `Read` the image so they can see it.
- Prompts do better with medium detail — subject, style, lighting, composition, mood. If the request is one or two words, expand it into a fuller prompt and say what you used, so they can adjust.
- Iterating on a result is usually an edit of the previous output, not a fresh generation — `--edit` on the API route, an attached image on the browser route. Keep it in the same run folder so the lineage stays together.
- Pick a `--slug` that reads well as a folder name (`hero-banner`, `login-empty-state`) rather than letting a long prompt truncate into one.
- The run folders are a record, not clutter to clean up. Leave `prompt.md` in place — it's how a good result gets reproduced later.

## After generating: is this headed for the web?

Both routes return PNG, which is a fine master and a bad thing to ship. If the image is going onto a site or app, hand off to the `imagile-dev-tools:web-optimize` skill to produce AVIF/WebP derivatives — the run folder keeps the PNG master, and `web/` gets the served files.

Assess before acting, don't optimize reflexively. A slide graphic, a print asset, a mockup, or an image the user just wants to look at should stay a PNG. That skill carries the full decision framework; the short version is that a web project plus a real payoff means yes, and anything else means mention it and move on.

Two related calls at generation time:

- If you already know the image is web-bound and no PNG master is needed, the API route's `--format webp --compression 80` skips a conversion step entirely.
- If the ask is a logo, icon, or flat geometric mark **for a website**, say that SVG beats any generated raster before spending a generation on it. Image models don't produce clean vector output.

## Self-healing

If a script misbehaves (a parameter the API now rejects, a new model id, a changed response shape) or the ChatGPT UI has moved enough that the steps above no longer describe it, fix `scripts/generate_image.py`, `scripts/chatgpt_ui.py`, and this SKILL.md directly rather than only working around it for the current run.
